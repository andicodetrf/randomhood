//STATE - an object that describes your application. & state that decribes this application is the robots and whatever is entered in the search box and state is able to change, able to change the value of the search box (val of input) and change what gets displayed.
//a parent feeds state into a child component and as soon as child component receive a state, it is a property; that child can never change that property. the parent just tells it what state is, and the child receives as robot.

//PROPS - property that we keep passing down. props are always just input that we get and we never modify them. props are things that come out of State


//CHILDREN - 

//state usually live in parent component. things that can change and affect our app. the parent component that passes the state to diff children components
